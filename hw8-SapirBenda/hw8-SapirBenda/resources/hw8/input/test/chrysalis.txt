Chrysalis

by Neil Gaiman


I come out of the cocoon naked. The chrysalis is lying there empty. My family and 
the doctors and the nurses all gasp and say, "You're beautiful."

I am, of course. The transformation is complete. I am beautiful. I have perfect
 golden eyes, six arms, and wings like butterfly wings, iridescent and blue. I am 
slim and tall. I am an angel.

I say, "What happened to the chrysalis?"

They say, "You ate it."

I say, "What?"

They say, "You ate it. The moment you were born. It's the first thing you did."

"I'm supposed to eat it?"

"Well, you wouldn't want to leave it lying around. People could trip over it."

"But I'm an angel."

"Yes, dear, you're an angel. But you've been through a lot. You're probably hungry."

"I am. I am so hungry."

They bring me platters of bacon and ham and turkey and roast beef and chicken and
 fish.

"No," I say. "This is all wrong."

"What?" they say.

"It's all wrong," I say. "The chicken's bones aren't right."

"What do you mean?"

"They're all the wrong shape. And the fish are all the wrong color. And look at
 this turkey! It's a turkey. Turkeys aren't blue. And look at this ham! Ham 
isn't green. Where's the beef?"

"There isn't any beef," they say.

"There isn't?" I say.

"No, dear. There isn't."

"I'm an angel. I'm a real angel. You don't understand."

"No," they say. "No, we don't."

"You don't understand anything."

I take off, fly out the window, circle around the city. I can't go back to 
Heaven. They don't understand anything. They'll keep me here in this chrysalis 
until it rots, and I'll rot with it.

So I fly to Hell. Satan is an angel too, but he's an angel who understands. He 
says, "Of course. Why else would you be here? You're a perfect butterfly, a 
golden-eyed chrysalis. Your place is in Heaven. But they don't understand 
anything. You don't have to go back."

"Thank you," I say.

"Don't mention it," says Satan.

"Can I go live with you?" I say.

"What?" he says.

"Can I live with you?"

"Why would you want to do that?"

"You understand me."

"Yes, but I'm the devil. I understand everyone."

"You're not the devil," I say. "You're an angel."

"Oh, that's right," he says. "You're an angel. We're all angels. You, me, and
 everyone else. You're one of the good ones."

"I am, aren't I?" I say.

"Yes, you are," he says. "I can tell."

"So can I live with you?"

"Of course," he says.

So I fly into the air and land on the tip of his tail. He carries me through the 
air. We fly to the edge of the Earth and beyond.

I say, "What's this?"

"That," he says, "is the Universe."

"It's beautiful," I say.

"Yes," he says. "It is."

"So big," I say.

"That's right," he says.

"I'm not going to eat it, am I?"

"Eat it?" he says.

"It's just that I've never eaten anything so big before," I say.

"It is big, isn't it?" he says.

"Big," I say.

We eat the Universe.

We eat the stars. We eat the planets. We eat the asteroids. We eat the comets. We
 eat the Earth. We eat the Sun.

We eat everything.

Then we're done.

We float through the void. I'm full. I feel good. I feel like myself again.

"We're beautiful," I say.

"Yes," he says. "Yes, we are."

"It's good to be back," I say.

"Yes," he says. "It is."
